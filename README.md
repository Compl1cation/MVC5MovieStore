# MVC5MovieStore
Fictional online movie store using ASP .NET MVC5

This project is my first big one and i used it for my bachelor's diploma paper. I decided, since website design is what i like doing, learning more about it should be my goal.

I'm not an expert with C# yet, but i like how the concepts behind Object Oriented Programming fit into web design, so i decided to use ASP .NET MVC5.

This site is still under development and will be updated with minor improvements in the coming weeks.

In order to access the control panels you have to login with username: masteradmin and password: 123456

The user manager control panel is not yet finished but all the others are and you can freely control the site's content.
