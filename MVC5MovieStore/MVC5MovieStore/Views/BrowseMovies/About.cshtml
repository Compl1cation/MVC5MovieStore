<div id="about">
<p>Greetings to everyone that has decided to check out my website. My name is Deyan Rusinov and here's where i write a little something about myself.</p>
<p>I graduated last year, studying Informatics at st.st. Cyril and Methodius in Veliko Turnovo.</p>
<p>This project is my first big one and i used it for my bachelor's diploma paper. I decided, since website design is what i like doing, learning more about it should be my goal.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert with C# yet, but i like how the concepts behind Object Oriented Programming fit into web design, so i decided to use ASP .NET MVC5.</p>
<p>I discovered that learning about all the different things it can offer can sometimes be tedious, but once you understand how to use them, it makes your life much simpler.</p>
<p>This site is still under development and will be updated with minor improvements in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In order to access the control panels you have to login with username: masteradmin and password: 123456</p>
<p>The user manager control panel is not yet finished but all the others are and you can freely control the site's content.</p>
