<div id="about">
<p>Greetings to everyone that has decided to check out my website. My name is Deyan Rusinov and here's where i write a little something about myself.</p>
<p>I'm a last year(hopefully) Informatics studen at st.st. Cyril and Methodius in Veliko Turnovo.</p>
<p>This project is for my bachelor's diploma paper. I decided, since website design is what i like doing, learning more about it should be my goal.</p>
<p>I'm not very good with C# yet, but i like how the concepts behind Object Oriented Programming fit into web design, so i decided to use ASP .NET MVC5.</p>
<p>I discovered that learning about all the different things it can offer can sometimes be tedious, but once you understand how to use them, it makes your life much simpler.</p>
<p>This site is still under development and will be updated with minor improvements in the coming days.</p>
